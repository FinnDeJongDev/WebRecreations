## Hey...

If you somehow stumbled upon this repository.... welcome.

This repository is a collection of websites recreations and techniques for websites which I've made for practice and documentation.

If you find an issue, things you want to see and/or know better solutions. Let me know!

(As for the reason why I created it)
Sometimes I see a website and think... "I can make that". So now I'm putting money where my mouth is.
